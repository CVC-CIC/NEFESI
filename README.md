## Selectivity indexes
_**Definition:**_ a property related to a neuron that measures how much the neuronal response (*i.e.*, the neuron activity) is affected by changes in the stimulus. In this sense, a high selectivity index characterizes a neuron to be highly dependent to a specific property, therefore, when this property is slightly changed, the neuron activity is considerably decreased.

### Selectivity indexes included
* **Color selectivity index**: measures the activity of a neuron to an input stimulus presenting certain color bias. 
  * _High value_: the neuron is sensitive to a color
  * _Low value_: the neuron is not sensitive to a color
  
* **Symmetry selectivity index**: measures the activity of a neuron to an input stimulus presenting a mirror symmetry property.
  * _High value_:  the neuron is sensitive to a mirror symmetry
  * _Low value_: the neuron is not sensitive to a mirror symmetry
  
* **Orientation selectivity index**: measures the activity of a neuron to an input stimulus presenting an orientation bias.
  * _High value_:  the neuron is sensitive to orientation
  * _Low value_: the neuron is not sensitive to orientation
  
* **Class selectivity index**: measures the activity of a neuron to an input stimulus related to a specific class.
  * _High value_: the neuron is sensitive to a feature that belongs to a class
  * _Low value_:  the neuron is sensitive to features found in several classes
